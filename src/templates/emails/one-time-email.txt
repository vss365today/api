#vss365 today
Pending permanent archival

Hey there, I'm Caleb, creator of vss365today.com. You are receiving this email because at some
point, you signed up for the daily email notifications containing the latest #vss365 prompt.

It is with much sorrow and sadness that I must announce this.


#vss365 today is entering permanent archival on December 31, 2023. After that day, it will no longer
be updated with the newest prompt or send out email notifications. Additionally, no new email
subscriptions will be accepted starting December 17, 2023.

This is happening due to a variety of circumstances, which I have outlined on my blog.

Thank you for supporting and embracing me and this hobby project of mine. It's been a privilege to
see the hashtag grow, to be included in the anthology twice, and have the personal fulfillment of
seeing something I created on a literal whim 5 years ago reach nearly 700 people's inbox a day
(as well as a unknown number of daily visitors to the site).

I'm not going anywhere, and maybe I can get back to participating in the prompt again.
I'll see you soon with the #vss365 Wrapped 2023 stats.
